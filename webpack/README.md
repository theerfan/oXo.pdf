Disclaimer:

This is a fork of pdf.js that's supposed to get it working the way I want it to work.
All licenses and what not belong to their respective owners, I frankly don't give enough craps to go find them to give them their dues, nor do I care enough to want to steal their credits.

These are my issues with how pdf.js currently goes about things:

1. I don't care about none of that gulp nonsense and this project not compiling on windows without major hurdles
2. It's lacking some features that I'd like to see in there, which was the whole point of me making this repo in the first place.
3. I'll try to self-host this on some github website or something so (hopefully) anyone with any browser will be able to use it without having to download anything. (The caveat is that I also don't care about google chrome so I might just stop trying when it starts working on firefox)
4. The "old" version of this repo is what you see in the home folder, the pdf.js fork is in the "webpack" folder. I literally had to copy the webpacked folder and manually un-webpack it to get it to a place where I can work with things.
5. This project is a mess, but I'll try to clean it up as I go along.
6. This project is motivated by [Dingboard](https://dingboard.com).

# oxo.bun
Open-source full-feature PDF editor in TypeScript (and bun!)

[Development in Bun stopped because it still has too many bugs to fix for me to be able to reliably use it for this project. Wishing them the best though!
Continuing this project as the oxo.js repo]


Notes:
- Need to add [https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/pdf.js/2.6.347/pdf.worker.entry.js] to the proper node_modules folder and change its direction to ask for the .mjs file.
